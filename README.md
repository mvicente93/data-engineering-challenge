# Data Engineering Challenge


Welcome to our Data Engineering Challenge repository üññ

If you found this repository it probably means that you are participating in our recruitment process. Thank you for your time and energy. If that's not the case please take a look at our [opening](https://jobs.lever.co/unbabel/2e537b5d-5e6c-40f2-a357-819815e8543f) and apply!

Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge, read it careful and take your time and think about the solution. Also, please for this repository because we will evaluate the code on the fork.

This is an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way. If have some doubt please open and issue and we'll reach out to help.

Good luck!

## Challenge Scenario

At Unbabel we deal we a lot of translation data. One of the metrics we use for our clients' SLAs is the delivery time of a translation. 

In the context of this problem, and to keep things simple, our translation flow is going to be modeled as only one event.

### *translation_delivered*

Example:

```json
{
	"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:12:19.903159",
	"translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4",
	"source_language": "en",
	"target_language": "fr",
	"client_name": "easyjet",
	"event_name": "translation_delivered",
	"duration": 20,
	"nr_words": 100
}
```

## Challenge Objective

Your mission is to build a simple command line application that parses a stream of events and produces an aggregated output. In this case, we're instered in calculating, for every minute, a moving average of the translation delivery time for the last X minutes.

If we want to count, for each minute, the moving average delivery time of all translations for the past 10 minutes we would call your application like (feel free to name it anything you like!).

	unbabel_cli --input_file events.json --window_size 10
	
The input file format would be something like:

	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:11:08.509654","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa5","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "easyjet","event_name": "translation_requested","nr_words": 30, "duration": 20}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:15:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "easyjet","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 31}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:23:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75bb33","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "booking","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 100, "duration": 54}


The output file would be something in the following format.

```
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:11:00", "average_delivery_time": 0}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:12:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:13:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:14:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:15:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:16:00", "average_delivery_time": 35,5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:17:00", "average_delivery_time": 35,5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:18:00", "average_delivery_time": 35,5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:19:00", "average_delivery_time": 35,5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:20:00", "average_delivery_time": 35,5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:21:00", "average_delivery_time": 35,5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:22:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:23:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:24:00", "average_delivery_time": 58}
```

#### Notes

Before jumping right into implementation we advise you to think about the solution first. We will evaluate, not only if your solution works but also the following aspects:

+ Simple and easy to read code. Remember that [simple is not easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)
+ Always keep in mind the SOLID principles
+ Always test your code and remember that tests are also a form of documentation. [The magic of testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M)
+ Make your application modular and easy to extend. [Clean Architecture](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
+ Be consistent in your code. 

We want you to solve this challenge in the language you feel most confortable with. Our machines run Python, Ruby, Scala, Java, Clojure, Elixir and Nodejs. If you are thinking of using any other programming language please reach out to us first üôè.

Also if you have any problem please **open an issue**. 

Good luck and may the force be with you

#### Extra points

If you feeling creative feel free to consider any additional cases you might find interesting. Remember this is a bonus, focus on delivering the solution first.
